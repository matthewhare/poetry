Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow sorry for the lost Lenore
From that rare and raidiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Filled me--thrilled me!--with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
